Total Bilirubin----This is a blood test that measures the amount of a substance called bilirubin.

A small amount of bilirubin in your blood is normal, but a high level may be a sign of liver disease.


Direct Bilirubin==Bilirubin is a substance made when your body breaks down old red blood cells

A small amount of bilirubin in your blood is normal. Healthy adults make 250 to 350 milligrams (mg) of bilirubin each day.


alkphos Alkaline Phosphotase====An alkaline phosphatase (ALP) test measures the amount of ALP in your blood. 
ALP is an enzyme found throughout the body, but it is mostly found in the liver, bones, kidneys, and digestive system. 
When the liver is damaged, ALP may leak into the bloodstream. High levels of ALP can indicate liver disease or bone disorders.

An alkaline phosphatase test is used to detect diseases of the liver or bones.


sgpt Alamine Aminotransferase====An enzyme found in the liver and other tissues. A high level of SGPT released into the blood may be a sign of liver 
damage, cancer, or other diseases. Also called alanine transferase and serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase.



sgot Aspartate Aminotransferase===An enzyme found in the liver, heart, and other tissues. A high level of SGOT released into the blood may be a 
sign of liver or heart damage, cancer, or other diseases. Also called aspartate transaminase and serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase.

tot_proteins===== The total protein test measures the total amount albumin and globulin in your body. Itâ€™s used as part of your routine health checkup. 
It may also be used if you have unexpected weight loss, fatigue, or the symptoms of a kidney or liver disease.

albumin====Albumin is a protein made by the liver. A serum albumin test measures the amount of this protein in the clear liquid portion of the blood. 
Albumin can also be measured in the urine. Blood is drawn from a vein (venipuncture), usually from the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.
